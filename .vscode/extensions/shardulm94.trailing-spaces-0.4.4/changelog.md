# Change Log


## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-22
### Fixed
- Fixed trailing-space highlights desyncing between split panes showing the same file: editing in one pane now refreshes the decorations in every visible pane, so highlights no longer go missing or leave a stale sliver behind (#71)


## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-19
### Fixed
- Fixed `trimOnSave` not trimming when the saved document's editor is hidden, e.g. with `files.autoSave: onFocusChange` (#76)
- Guarded `trimOnSave` against stale edits so a concurrent edit or another save participant can no longer cause real content to be corrupted (#80)
### Changed
- Modernized the build: the extension is now bundled with esbuild, dependencies were refreshed, and the test suite and CI were updated


## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-19
### Fixed
- Fixed a deprecation warning caused by the use of the deprecated `util.isNullOrUndefined` API


## [0.4.1] - 2022-07-10
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where changing settings would result in previously highlighted regions being permanently highlighted
### Changed
- `highlightCurrentLine` now considers all active cursors as current lines


## [0.4.0] - 2022-07-08
### Fixed
- Fix an issue where only the first line of each block of modified lines is trimmed when `deleteModifiedLinesOnly` is set
### Changed
- Extension will now activate only after VSCode startup has finished to avoid VSCode startup slowdown


## [0.3.1] - 2019-04-08
### Changed
- Trigger `trimOnSave` on auto-saves along with manual saves to maintain backward compatibility


## [0.3.0] - 2019-04-06
### Added
- Allow specific schemes to be ignored.
- Add options to change background and border colors of highlighting.
- Add option to disable status bar message.

### Changed
- Only attach VSCode event listeners if current settings require them.
- Major refactor to simplify the core extension logic.
- Ignore `output` scheme by default

### Fixed
- Fix "Trim on Save" requiring file to be saved twice.
- Fix error when trying to read saved document for non-file schemes.

### Removed
- Remove "Save after Trim" as current VSCode lifecycle for text editor commands does not provide a clean way to implement this feature.
- Remove `deleteInFolder` and `deleteInFolderRecursive` functionality which was experimental.
